# odin-library

This is the 1st project of the course *JavaScript* from the curriculum
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This project requires me to use the knowledge of Objects and Prototypes
learned in the relevant lessons, and apply them here to make a simple
Library class.

I have done my best.
